# Indeginous (Cree) Language Translation

#### This project provides a Cree language translation tool that converts text between Standard Roman Orthography (SRO) and Syllabics form.

## Problem
Currently, there is no available application or tool that can accurately and efficiently perform Cree language translation between SRO and Syllabics. This limitation hinders effective communication and language preservation efforts within the Cree community.  

## Solution
This project aims to address this gap by developing a simple Cree language translation tool. By providing this example implementation script, we hope to empower Cree language learners and speakers to bridge the linguistic divide and strengthen their cultural heritage.


## Some Random Example Translations

Convert SRO to syllabics

(inside) 'pîhc-âyihk' -> 'ᐲᐦᒑᔨᕽ'

(sun) 'pîsim' -> 'ᐱᓯᑦ'

Convert syllabics to SRO

(dog)  'ᐊᑎᑦ' ->  'atim'

(autumn) 'ᑕᑲᑭᐣ' -> 'takwâcin'
